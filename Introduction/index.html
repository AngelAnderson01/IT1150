    <img src = "images/Angel.jpg" alt="This is a picture of Angel" style="float:right;width:275px;height:275px">
    <p> My name is Angel. I have always been interested at learning more about computers and how they worked. That is why I figured I should start a career in Programming and Development.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">What do I hope to get out of this class?</h2>
    <p>I hope to learn more about programming web pages and to really retain the information that I learn.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;" >My goals after graduating from Tri-C</h2>
    <p> My goals after Tri-C are to get a job doing what I enjoy. Of course that has to deal with computers. I really want to be employed to develop new software and test the software out.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">"Big Dream" goals</h2>
    <p> A big dream goal of mine is to own my own business. I am not sure what I would do for my business. However, I am really a big nerd and I think I would enjoy being a financial advisor.</p>
