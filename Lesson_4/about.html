      <h3>Fenora</h3>
      <p>Fenora is located on a little island in Nova Scotia. Fenora is about 69 acres big. As of March 2021 there are a little under 500 people living in Fenora. Most people that live here are retired and enjoy the peace and quiet, however most still enjoy working and comute to town most days. We do not see a lot of tourism because of our strict regulations, but when we do allow people to enter our city they are friendly, kind, and always respectful. Even though we have such high standards here, our crime rate is pretty moderate, most of the crimes that take place are violates to our high standards of always being kind and having a smile on your face at all times.</p>
