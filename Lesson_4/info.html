          <h3>Taxes and Cost of Living</h3>
          <p> We are such a small island with not many residents, so have a high cost of living. Since none of our residents can leave they all own their homes, with our cheapest property at 1 million dollars. Besides our fruit that we grow, and fish we gather; any imported food runs about 3 times the normal cost.</p>
          <p> Our residents pay several different taxes at various rates. Most residents pay 50% of their gross pay in city taxes, but that's okay because all of our residents are weathly and do not need their money from the jobs they work in town anyways!</p>

        <article id="weather" class="tabcontent col-6 col-s-9">
          <h3>Learn about our weather and more!</h3>
          <p> Between May and July, our weather is amazing! 80 degrees fahrenheit and 80% of the time sunny! </p>
          <p> Between August and November our average temperature is 65 degrees fahernheit with several rain showers per week. </p> 
          <p> December is our one month of harsh winter weather with the average temperature around -10 degrees fahrenheit.</p> 
          <p> Between January and April is our spring time, average temperatures around 55 degrees fahrenheit but we have serious tropical storms around this time of year as well!</p>
          <p> During the spring time our pollution is at a medium level because all of our residents have mandatory work in town to do, their commuting causes our pollution levels to rise - but that's okay because they only work from January to April and have the rest of the year off!</p>
