<br> <br> Every wonder how you are able to type in a websites name and it goes directly to it? Well you can thank ICANN for being able to type the name instead of the IP address of that website. ICANN helps link the websites name to it's IP address; since that is how computers on the network know it. [4]
<br> <br> ICANN created the <a href="https://www.icann.org/registrants" target="_blank">Registrant Program</a> which helps raise awareness about the issues and challenges registrants face.[5]
